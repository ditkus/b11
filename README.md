# AVM

This is a Automated Valuation Model for Commercial Real Estate Valuations. This model is still in process and is not ready to use for now. The model should be able to produce Comercial Real Estate Veluations using following variables of specific country (this list is being updated):

  - Demographic data (population growth, population age distribution, migration).
  - Employment data.
  - Economic growth data.
  - Consumer spending data.
  - Import/Export activity data.
  - Interest rate time series data.
  - Historic valuation data on comparables. 
  - Lease and lease history data. 
  - Property tax data.
  
### Installation

This AVM should be build with easy to use API.



### Usage

The guidance will be provided soon.

**Be patient!**
