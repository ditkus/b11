# AVM

This is an Automated Valuation Model for Commercial Real Estate Valuations. This model is still in process and is not ready to use. The model should be able to produce Commercial Real Estate Veluations using following variables of specific country (the list is being updated):

  - Demographic data (population growth, population age distribution, migration).
  - Employment data.
  - Economic growth data.
  - Consumer spending data.
  - Import/Export activity data.
  - Interest rate time series data.
  - Historic valuation data on comparables. 
  - Lease and lease history data. 
  - Vacancy rates.
  - Property tax data.
  
### Installation

This AVM will have an easy to use API.



### Usage

The guidance will be provided soon.

**Be patient!**
